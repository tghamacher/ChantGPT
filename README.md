# ChantGPT

**Version 0.1.0** · a working title

ChantGPT will read scans of Gregorian chant, from printed books and manuscripts, and give you the music in GABC (the
format of [Gregorio](https://gregorio-project.github.io/)), with the places it isn't sure of marked for you to check
against the page. Renaissance mensural notation comes after that.

Everything runs in your browser. Your scans are never uploaded.

## What it does now

This is the first step. You can:

- open a PDF of a chant book, or photographs or scans of its pages (JPEG, PNG, WebP);
- page through it and zoom.

Next comes an editor for marking staves, clefs, neumes and syllables on the page by hand, and GABC from that. After it,
finding staves by itself, and then recognition.

## Running it on your computer

The app is plain HTML and JavaScript, with no build step. Browsers won't run it straight from the folder (`file://`),
so serve the folder, for example with Python:

```
python -m http.server 8000
```

and open http://localhost:8000.

## Tests

- In a browser: serve the folder as above and open http://localhost:8000/test/ (add `?only=gabc` to run some).
- With Node, the tests that don't need a browser: `node test/node.js`.

## The pieces

- `index.html`, `css/site.css`, `js/app.js`: the page and its controls.
- `js/viewer.js`: opens PDFs (with [pdf.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/), kept in `vendor/pdfjs`) and images,
  and draws one page at a time.
- `js/chant.js`: the document format (GABC placed on the page), reading and writing GABC, and checks. See
  [docs/format.md](docs/format.md).
- `HANDOFF.md`: the plan.
